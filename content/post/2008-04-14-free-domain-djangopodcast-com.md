So, I bought the domain djangopodcast.com over 2 years ago with the obvious intention of starting a show about Django, the amazing web framework written in Python. Somewhere along the way I fell head over heels for this beauty called Ruby and going back to Python, although attractive in her own way, just did not feel right to me.

If you, or anyone you know, would like to host djangopodcast.com, similar to the great work of Michael Trier, send an email to my name at me.com.

The winner will simply have to transfer the domain to their registrar, at their cost of course, with the authorization codes that I will provide. I want nothing else but to be recognized as the person who donated the domain, and maybe a beer.

Good luck!
