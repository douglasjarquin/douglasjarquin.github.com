This is the first in a series of posts where I single out design rips from all over the web. Todays crook is Tech Support Guy who shamelessly copied the Digg.com design.

I am all for being inspired by someone elseâ€™s design, but this is not inspiration. Even the login Javascript behaviors were copied. Petty Tech Support Guy, just petty.
