  <h1>Radiohead makes millions selling a free album</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 17, 2007</span>
      <p>Radiohead shocked the music industry, and their fans, by releasing their latest album “In Rainbows” for free. Yes, free as in beer. You pay as much as you think the album is worth.</p>

<p>The Seminal writes:</p>

<p>According to a source close to the band, In Rainbows has sold approximately 1.2 million copies as of October 12th. In comparison, that’s more albums sold in the first week than Radiohead’s last three releases combined. According to an Internet poll of 3,000 people, the average price paid for In Rainbows was $8. If these numbers are accurate, Radiohead has made close to $10 million in one week on this album alone.</p>

<p>This is crazy, but awesome in its own way. Just goes to show how far you can bend without breaking. Visit The Seminal to check the full article out.</p>
