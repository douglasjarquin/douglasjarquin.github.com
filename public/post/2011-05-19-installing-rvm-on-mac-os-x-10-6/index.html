  <h1>Installing RVM on Mac OS X 10.6</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, May 19, 2011</span>
      <p>I recently got a new MacBook Pro, and haven’t gotten around to installing RVM yet. So when I took on this task today, I was totally surprised buy the issues I faced.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>Git
Terminal chops
Installation</p>

<p>The default installation method is the easiest, so I suggest you follow it. As documented on the official RVM site, just use this one-liner:</p>

<p>That’s it, or so I thought.</p>

<p>Caveats</p>

<p>RVM will likely not work as expected</p>

<p>I kept getting the following error messages:</p>

<p>Not exactly sure what is causing it yet, but the solution is to remove RVM, and retry the installation.</p>

<p>I actually had to repeat this process four times before I did not see these errors anymore.</p>

<p>Command not found</p>

<p>The next problem I faced was that the rvm command wasn’t in my path. Luckily, I found the executable after a quick search. It lives at:</p>

<p>However, simply adding that to your path isn’t the solution. It actually didn’t even work for me. Instead, add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc, respectively.</p>

<p>Bash</p>

<p>ZSH</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>So, my curious side wants to know exactly why this is happening, but I got nowhere. Some have solved the problem by setting some permissions, but that solutions seemed to hacky for me.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
