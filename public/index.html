    <p>The Truth</p>

<p>Okay, that title is a bit misleading. I mean, how do you almost co-found one of the most important technology businesses of our time, yet be basically unknown in the technology industry.</p>

<p>Yes, I am just a rat race running, weekend entrepreneur. No, I didn’t exactly “almost” co-found GitHub, but I really do think I had an opportunity to. This is the story of how I missed that opportunity.</p>

<p>The Story</p>

<p>It was about 5 years ago today, and Rails was just beginning to make its now historical mark on the development world. During my research, I came across a blog app written in Rails named Ozimodo. It was one of the first, and especially in the beginning, it was raw.</p>

<p>You’ve got to understand, the Rails community at this time was still new. There were many frustrations still to be had, and there was no GitHub to enable painless collaboration.</p>

<p>I downloaded the source code off of SourceForge, and made some improvements. Today, I would make a Pull Request, my work might be merged, and I would be honored as a committer. So what did I do when I made some improvements to the app? Well, I emailed the developer. And who was this developer? None other than Chris Wanstrath.</p>

<p>I had a couple of app improvements, and I also completely refactored the templates removing the old school table based layouts that Chris was using. In my email I explained that, but Chris wanted to know how I did what I did.</p>

<p>I vividly remember starting to write the reply, then letting something else have my attention. To my dismay, I never finished the email.</p>

<p>I never got to show Chris my skills. I never got to network with him. I never got to learn from him. And then of course, I never got to co-found GitHub with him.</p>

<p>The Moral</p>

<p>Use the tools we have today to show off your work. Fork a hugely important project, and commit something meaningful. Let other developers see your work, get feedback, and learn from them. It’s now easier than ever, and you never know what that commit might lead to. A new job, a resume bullet point, or maybe a future business partner.</p>

    <p>For those who don’t know me, I am very cheap. Actually, it’s a point of pride, and something I reflect in a positive light. I don’t think it’s bad to be frugal. This is true for the way I host my Git repositories too.</p>

<p>At any given time I have a dozen of so tiny repositories filled with little experiments of mine. Instead of paying $300 a year, I just stick them in my free Dropbox account.</p>

<p>Up</p>

<p>From your git working directory:</p>

<p>Then, to push your changes to Dropbox, just run:</p>

<p>Obviously, change out master for your branch name. Alternatively, you could set th branch to track from Dropbox by default with:</p>

<p>Down</p>

<p>Once your repository lives in Dropbox, cloning it is as simple as:</p>

<p>If you want to have a dropbox remote instead of the default origin run:</p>

<p>Pushing up changes follows the same steps listed above, and this all works for shared directories, too.</p>

<p>I can’t take credit for any of this, so below are the multiple sources where I pieced this together from.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, May 19, 2011</span>

    <p>I recently got a new MacBook Pro, and haven’t gotten around to installing RVM yet. So when I took on this task today, I was totally surprised buy the issues I faced.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>Git
Terminal chops
Installation</p>

<p>The default installation method is the easiest, so I suggest you follow it. As documented on the official RVM site, just use this one-liner:</p>

<p>That’s it, or so I thought.</p>

<p>Caveats</p>

<p>RVM will likely not work as expected</p>

<p>I kept getting the following error messages:</p>

<p>Not exactly sure what is causing it yet, but the solution is to remove RVM, and retry the installation.</p>

<p>I actually had to repeat this process four times before I did not see these errors anymore.</p>

<p>Command not found</p>

<p>The next problem I faced was that the rvm command wasn’t in my path. Luckily, I found the executable after a quick search. It lives at:</p>

<p>However, simply adding that to your path isn’t the solution. It actually didn’t even work for me. Instead, add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc, respectively.</p>

<p>Bash</p>

<p>ZSH</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>So, my curious side wants to know exactly why this is happening, but I got nowhere. Some have solved the problem by setting some permissions, but that solutions seemed to hacky for me.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <p>I recently started using Navicat for MySQL as my Mac database administration application of choice, and quickly wondered how I could back up my data. Particularly, Navicat has a great query interface, and in a few days I compiled 27 queries that I really did not want to have to rebuild.</p>

<p>Without over engineering a solution, and since there is no sensitive data to worry about as passwords are stored in Keychain, I decided to backup with Dropbox (referral link). I couldn’t move the directory into my Dropbox directory, which is my preferred method, so I went the symlink route.</p>

        How to add a CakePHP book to Coda
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 5, 2008</span>

    <p>I have to use PHP at work so I have been eyeing the CakePHP framework. Although it is nowhere near Rails in my opinion is does have some documentation and a big enough community. As my PHP development tool of choice I use Coda, from Panic. I know one of the latest features of Coda 1.5 was the ability to add your own Books so I thought I would write about how I setup a CakePHP book.</p>

<p>The assets</p>

<p>First, lets download the CakePHP Book logo I threw together. It took me awhile to get the image to align correctly in Coda, but if you have a better one let me know.</p>

<p>cake-book-logo.png.zip
My inspiration came from the small CakePHP book on the “Learn” tab of the homepage.</p>

<p>Settings</p>

<p>Now in Coda, click “Books” and then the “+” sign at the bottom to add a new book. Make sure your settings match this:</p>

<p>Note: You have to click and drag the image into the “Cover Image” box to apply the graphic.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>Hit “OK” and voila. Your very own CakePHP Book right in Coda.</p>

    <p>Google Chrome is the new browser on the block, and boy is it getting all the neighborhood girls excited. I am sure you can find some entertaining article about why Google Chrome will rule the world, but I am going to tell you why I like it. Webkit. Yes, Google Chrome uses the exact same rendering engine as Safari which is my browser of choice, mobile Safari, and Android. This means that any site that renders well in Safari will look the same in Google Chrome.</p>

<p>What this also means is that if the adoption of Google Chrome is high enough, which it will be, web designers all over the world can finally give IE the boot. I see the signs already, “This site works fine in Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.” That’s three choices other than IE.</p>

    <p>There are many tutorials out there on how to back up your Mac to Amazon S3, but over time this process has been simplified.</p>

<p>Requisites</p>

<p>Before we get started we will need a few things. Also, make sure you have your Amazon S3 access identifiers at hand. You can get those from your AWS account.</p>

<p>Amazon S3 account
Mac OS X Leopard
Terminal Skills
Back it up</p>

<p>In order to keep this under five minutes I am simply going to list the steps required and not going to really go into any major detail.</p>

<p>First</p>

<p>Install the S3Sync Ruby Gem. Read more about Ruby Gems here.</p>

<p>Second</p>

<p>Add your Amazon access identifiers to the top of your .bash_login file.</p>

<p>Third</p>

<p>Execute the command to backup where my_backup_bucket is the name of your bucket.</p>

<p>I personally do not like to schedule the backups with a cron because every time it runs I am doing something important. I suggest you create an alias for the command in your .bash_login file like this:</p>

<p>Then all you have to do is type backup whenever you want to run this command. Easy.</p>

<p>If the Terminal is not your kind of interface or your just want to backup a few folders of important files, I suggest you go with a full blown S3 file manager. Here are some of the applications I have used.</p>

        Java and Tomcat on Ubuntu Hardy
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 4, 2008</span>

    

<p>I just spent my entire morning trying to figure out how to install Tomcat on one of my servers. I needed it to demo a business intelligence application, and boy oh boy was it a pain. There is a lot of talk out there about this particular install, but nothing specifically for Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy.</p>

<p>What follows is a quick guide on how to setup Java 1.6.0 and Tomcat 5.5 on a “new” Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron server. We will be using apt-get to install everything, since I hate having to remember to update compiled code.</p>

<p>First things first</p>

<p>First make sure Ubuntu is all up to date:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</p>

<p>Java</p>

<p>It was a little hidden, but Ubuntu does have a very detailed how-to for installing Java here. Okay, so it is not very detailed at all. I missed it a few times, but the install steps are there.</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre openjdk-6-jdk</p>

<p>OpenJDK is an open-source Java SDK implementation with support for Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy. Tomcat needs both the JRE and the JDK so make sure to install both if you have not already.</p>

<p>Check on Java</p>

<p>Just to make sure we are all good, run this command to verify that Java installed correctly:</p>

<p>java -version</p>

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

<p>java version &ldquo;1.6.0&rdquo;
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-b09)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.6.0-b09, mixed mode)</p>

<p>Tomcat</p>

<p>Tomcat was the hard part. There really is not much on the topic, since all Java Web developers are moving to Rails ;), but here is what I put together. There is a package available for Tomcat 5.5, and once installed successfully it will be running on port 8180 of your server. Let’s get to it.</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install apache2 tomcat5.5 tomcat5.5-webapps tomcat5.5-admin</p>

<p>Okay, I kind of let you down here, because the install will fail. Bare with me, it is all part of my plan. If you look carefully at the output you will see why Tomcat’s install failed so miserably.</p>

<p>Setting up tomcat5.5 (5.5.25-5ubuntu1) &hellip;
  * no JDK found - please set JAVA_HOME</p>

<p>Don’t you just love helpful error messages. And I welcome you to the part of the installation that took me hours to figure out. What is required for Tomcat to finish its installation is a simple environment variable. A single line of code that will tell Tomcat where to find our Java install. I tried putting this in the /root/.bashrc, .bash_login, .bash_profile, and ~/.bashrc with no success. I kept thinking there was something wrong with my syntax, but nothing worked. Luckily, I ran into this blog post when doing a Google search for the terms “No JDK found”.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Tomcat has its own place to set this environment variable. Jackpot! Oh, this is why we needed to let the install fail, to create this file for us.</p>

<p>sudo nano /etc/default/tomcat5.5</p>

<p>Then look for this line:</p>

<p>#JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun</p>

<p>And make it look like this:</p>

<p>JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk</p>

<p>Check the newly set JAVA_HOME with:</p>

<p>echo $JAVA_HOME</p>

<p>We did two things. First we uncommented the line, so Tomcat can parse the environment variable set here. Next, we corrected the path to our Java installation. You can check the Java path yourself by typing sudo update-alternatives &ndash;config java. Running which java or whereis java will only display symlinks.</p>

<p>So now we run our Tomcat installation command again. Run the whole command again just to make sure all of the packages get installed. If they were installed successfully they will be skipped, so no harm can come from doing this.</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install apache2 tomcat5.5 tomcat5.5-webapps tomcat5.5-admin</p>

<p>Java and Tomcat are now successfully installed! Visit <a href="http://localhost:8180">http://localhost:8180</a> to see how all of my hard work has paid off. Just in case, here are a few useful Tomcat commands:</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Check Tomcat&rdquo;s status</h1>

<p>sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 status</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">Start Tomcat</h1>

<p>sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 start</p>

        Quickbooks Online is retarded
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 4, 2008</span>

    <p>So I have recently decided to get my act together, and start up my business ventures again. It has been a few years though, so I need to get my hands on some new accounting software. “So much has changed”, I though to myself. “There is going to be a lot of really cool accounting software to choose from.” Man was I wrong.</p>

<p>I searched for days only to be left with sore fingers and a mild headache. There is nothing out there for a Mac using business owner. I mean nothing. Apparently, I am not the only business owner with this dilemma. Luc Latulippe wrote about the exact same problem over a year ago. I will write more about my research and which product I finally decide on in a few days, but one thing has my blood boiling right now.</p>

<p>Quickbooks, the long time leader of business accounting software, offers an online version of their application for $9.95 a month. That’s half the price of its nearest competitor, Less Accounting. While Less Accounting is very cool, and not intended to compete directly with Quickbooks, I find it hard to pay more for less. Remember, I am going into business here and rule number one is to be cheap. Quickbooks Online has more features, is very well priced, and my accountant does not need to learn anything new since all accountants know Quickbooks. As a matter of fact, Quickbooks Online offers a completely separate login account for specifically for accountants. Cool, huh?</p>

<p>Stupid</p>

<p>I usually will refrain from calling anyone stupid. It is unprofessional, usually hard to prove, and will put me in the line of fire. But the guys at Intuit are stupid. You see, you can only use Quickbooks Online from two web browsers.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer
Mobile Safari
Yes, Quickbooks online has an iPhone interface, but you can not use Safari for Mac. Over 25% of iPhone users own a Mac. Firefox, what’s that? Intuit is sitting on the best web based accounting software available at the moment, and then blocking tons of users because of browser compatibility. What the hell? It is nearly 2009, and you can not push out a cross browser web application? Wait, you can. You have the iPhone interface, but what about the Mac you dummies.</p>

<p>Sure, the web interface of Quickbooks Online will probably suck. Yes, there will be dozens of usability issues. Okay, it is probably extremely ugly. But remember it will do everything a small business will need for $10 a month, or it would if I could actually use it.</p>

<p>Unless you have been sleeping under a rock, which I hear is good for your health, you have come to hear about Git. Originally created by Linus Torvalds, Git is an open source version control system that has quickly gained a lot of traction with Rails developers. This could be credited to the great GitHub, but I think it is because of Git’s feature set. Visit the office Git website to learn more.</p>

<p>At $20 a month Media-Temples Grid-Service is an incredible bargain. I make extensive use of all of it features, including the recently added ability to host Git repositories. What follows is a tutorial on how to host your Git repositories on Media Temple’s Grid-Service from Mac OS Leopard.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>Git 1.5.6.2
Mac OS X Leopard
Terminal Skills
There are binaries available for installing Git on Mac OS X. Visit the git-osx-installer project on Google Code.</p>

<p>Domain</p>

<p>In order to be able to clone your repositories from the Grid over HTTP you need to create a domain specifically for Git. You can setup git.domain.com, but any domain will do. Remember to setup the domain in your Grid account. Without this you will only be able to clone Git repositories over ssh which is a pain.</p>

<p>The project</p>

<p>We are going to setup an example project called icecream-man. Change into a directory that is safe to work in and let’s get to it. If you already have a Git project setup you can skip this section.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">This is where I keep all of my projects</h1>

<p>cd Sites/
mkdir icecream-man
cd icecream-man
git init
touch .gitignore
git status
git add .
git commit -v -a</p>

<p>Attack of the Clones</p>

<p>Before we can push our local Git repositories to the Grid we have to create a bare clone. A short aside about what git means by bare: A default git repository assumes that you’ll be using it as your working directory, so git stores the actual bare repository files in a .git directory alongside all the project files. Remote repositories don’t need copies of the files on the filesystem unlike working copies, all they need are the deltas and binary what-nots of the repository itself. This is what bare means to git. Just the repository itself.</p>

<p>cd Sites/
git clone &ndash;bare icecream-man icecream-man.git
touch icecream-man.git/git-daemon-export-ok</p>

<p>Upload the repository</p>

<p>To get the project on our Grid I use scp, but you could just as easily FTP the icecream-man.git directory into your Grid account.</p>

<p>scp -r icecream-man.git serveradmin%s#####.gridserver.com@s#####.gridserver.com:domains/git.domain.com/html/icecream-man.git</p>

<p>Now we have to ssh into our Grid account and finalize the setup.</p>

<p>ssh serveradmin%s#####.gridserver.com@s#####.gridserver.com
cd domains/git.domain.com/html/icecream-man.git
git &ndash;bare update-server-info
chmod a+x hooks/post-update</p>

<p>Pulling</p>

<p>Now we are ready to clone our Git repository from our Grid account. We are able to clone using a pretty URL thanks to our Git specific domain. Yeah!</p>

<p>git clone <a href="http://git.domain.com/icecream-man.git">http://git.domain.com/icecream-man.git</a></p>

<p>Pushing</p>

<p>Once you have made some local commits that you want to push to the Grid you can use this command:</p>

<p>git push ssh://serveradmin%s#####.gridserver.com@s#####.gridserver.com/home/#####/domains/git.domain.com/html/icecream-man.git master</p>

<p>Here is what I do so that I do not have to type in that long command every time I want to push my changes to the remote Git repository. Git allows for each project to have multiple tracked repositories. Since we cloned our project from <a href="http://git.domain.com/icecream-man.git">http://git.domain.com/icecream-man.git</a> Git thinks it can push there to. Let’s add another remote repository and tell Git to push our changes there.</p>

<p>cd Sites/icecream-man/
git remote add grid ssh://serveradmin%s#####.gridserver.com@s#####.gridserver.com/home/#####/domains/git.domain.com/html/icecream-man.git</p>

<p>Now we can push changes to our Grid account using git push grid master. Git knows that the remote repository named grid corresponds to the Grid’s push URL. Much better, I know. We can take this even further and create an alias for the command in our “.bash_login&rdquo; file. To view the available remote locations type &ldquo;git remote&rdquo; from inside the project directory. Then you can view the details of a remote repository by typing &ldquo;git remote show grid”. I use this very heavily, and am successfully hosting six active Git repositories on my Grid account. Without this tiny shortcut I do not think I would be able to do it, and I would be GitHub bound.</p>

<p>sudo gem install cheat</p>

Data is stored on Amazon S3 in the back end, but Aireo stores aliases of your files in a database.

    <p>So, I bought the domain djangopodcast.com over 2 years ago with the obvious intention of starting a show about Django, the amazing web framework written in Python.

<p>If you, or anyone you know, would like to host djangopodcast.com, similar to the great work of Michael Trier, send an email to my name at me.com.</p>

<p>The winner will simply have to transfer the domain to their registrar, at their cost of course, with the authorization codes that I will provide. I want nothing else but to be recognized as the person who donated the domain, and maybe a beer.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <p>The other day I stumbled upon a very useful keyboard shortcut for Mac OS X Leopard. If you hit ‘option’ + ‘shift’ + ‘volume down’ or ‘volume up’ you will get a more sensitive volume control. Four times more sensitive to be exact. This is useful if you have very sensitive speakers that need a smaller adjustment to get to that perfect volume level.</p>

<p>You have surely heard of the latest thing to happen to version control. Git, written be Linux creator Linus Torvalds, is a popular version control system designed to handle very large projects with speed and efficiency. Installing Git on Mac OS X Leopard is actually pretty simple and blazingly fast. It installed so quickly I thought it was a mistake.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard (untested in Tiger)
Xcode 3.0
Terminal skills</p>

<p>Set Options since we don’t have GNU gettext installed</p>

<p>export TCL_PATH=/usr/bin/tclsh
export NO_MSGFMT=1
With those environment variables set we can move on to building Git.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Get and Install Git</h1>

<p>curl -O <a href="http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.5.6.2.tar.bz2">http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.5.6.2.tar.bz2</a>

    <p>At $20 a month, Media Temple’s Grid-Service is an incredible bargain. I recently broke up with Django and decided to move my work back to Ruby on Rails. What follows is another tentative guide to installing Mephisto on Media Temple’s Grid Service.</p>

<p>First things first</p>

<p>Enable Rails container</p>

<p>Log in to your (mt) account center and select your primary domain.
Click into the “(gs) GridContainers” section.
Click the “manage” link for the Rails GridContainer.
Click ‘Enable Container’.
Note: You will need about 45 MB of ram dedicated to Mephisto.</p>

<p>Create the database</p>

<p>Click into the ‘Manage Databases’ section.
Click the ‘Add A Database’ tab.
Give your database a name and select a database type.
Click ‘Next’.
Setting up Ruby on Rails</p>

<p>ssh serveradmin%domain.com@domain.com *<em>OS X Terminal
serveradmin@domain.com </em><em>Windows
mtr generate_config </em>*serveradmin@domain.com and password
mtr setup_rubygems
source ~/.bash_profile
gem install rails -y
gem install mysql &ndash;source=<a href="http://gems.mediatemple.net">http://gems.mediatemple.net</a>
gem install postgres &ndash;source=<a href="http://gems.mediatemple.netrngem">http://gems.mediatemple.netrngem</a> install daemons gem_plugin -y
gem install mongrel &ndash;source=<a href="http://gems.mediatemple.net">http://gems.mediatemple.net</a></p>

<p>Install Mephisto</p>

<p>cd $HOME/../../containers
mkdir rails &amp;&amp; cd rails
svn co -r 2920 <a href="http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/mephisto/trunk">http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/mephisto/trunk</a> mephisto
cd mephisto
gem install tzinfo &ndash;remote
cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml</p>

<p>Note: Here we checkout revision 2920 instead of the head. 2920 is the latest revision of Mephisto to work without rails edge, although the 0.7.3 release was revision 2501.</p>

<p>Initialize Mephisto</p>

<p>rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=production
mtr add mephisto $PWD domain.com
mtr start mephisto
mtr generate_htaccess mephisto
mtr create_link mephisto domain.com</p>

<p>Note: We do not have to manually create the log directory. It is automatically created when we rake the db.</p>

<p>That’s it! Now visit yourdomain.com to see our result.</p>

    <p>Using Subversion on the Media Temple Grid-Service is much easier than it seems. Actually, it is easier than my previous host.</p>

<p>Setup the repository</p>

<p>ssh serveradmin%domain.com@domain.com *<em>OS X
Terminalserveradmin@domain.com </em>*Windows
cd data
mkdir svn &amp;&amp; cd svn
svnadmin create &ndash;fs-type fsfs reponame</p>

<p>Initial import</p>

<p>On your local machine.</p>

<p>mkdir reponame &amp;&amp; cd reponame
mkdir trunk
mkdir tags
mkdir branches
svn import . svn+ssh://serveradmin%domain.com@s#####.gridserver.com/home/#####/data/svn/reponame/ -m &ldquo;Initial import&rdquo;</p>

<p>Checking out</p>

<p>Now that we have our subversion repository setup and our code checked in, we should check out a copy for development.</p>

<p>svn co svn+ssh://serveradmin%domain.com@s#####.gridserver.com/home/#####/data/svn/reponame/trunk reponame</p>

<p>Deployment</p>

<p>If you are going to deploy your website from a local subversion repository.</p>

<p>ssh serveradmin%domain.com@domain.com *<em>OS X Terminalserveradmin@domain.com </em>*Windows
cd domains
cd domain.com
mv html html-2
svn co file:///home/#####/data/svn/reponame/trunk html</p>

<p>That does it. Rinse and repeat as needed.</p>

<p>What follows is a tentative guide to installing Beast, a forum application written in Ruby on Rails, on Media Temple Grid-Service.</p>

<p>First things first</p>

<p>Enable Rails container</p>

<p>Log in to your (mt) account center and select your primary domain.
Click into the “(gs) GridContainers” section.
Click the “manage” link for the Rails GridContainer.
Click “Enable Container”.
Note: You will need about 35 MB of ram for Beast.</p>

<p>Create database</p>

<p>Click into the “Manage Databases” section.
Click the “Add A Database” tab.
Give your database a name and select a database type.
Click “Next”
Setup email</p>

<p>You must have a beast@domain.com user setup for sending activation emails.</p>

<p>Setting up Ruby on Rails</p>

<p>ssh serveradmin%domain.com@domain.com *<em>OS X Terminal
serveradmin@domain.com </em><em>Windows
mtr generate_config </em>*serveradmin@domain.com and password
mtr setup_rubygemssource ~/.bash_profile
gem install rails -y
gem install mysql &ndash;source=<a href="http://gems.mediatemple.net">http://gems.mediatemple.net</a>
gem install postgres &ndash;source=<a href="http://gems.mediatemple.net">http://gems.mediatemple.net</a>
gem install daemons gem_plugin -y
gem install mongrel &ndash;source=<a href="http://gems.mediatemple.net">http://gems.mediatemple.net</a></p>

<p>Installing the Beast</p>

<p>cd $HOME/../../containers
mkdir rails &amp;&amp; cd rails
svn co -r 2873 <a href="http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/beast/trunk">http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/beast/trunk</a> beast
cd beast
gem install RedCloth
gem install ruby-openid
cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml</p>

<p>Note: Instead of installing beast from the stable 1.0 branch we checkout revision 2873 from the trunk. This way we can update to stable versions of the trunk without having to worry about merging branches. Stable 1.0 is actually revision 2907, but I have not been able to install it successfully.</p>

<p>Edit database.yml</p>

<p>production:
adapter: mysql
database: db#####_beast_production
username: db#####
password: xxxxxxx
host: internal-db.s#####.gridserver.com</p>

<p>Edit environment.rb</p>

<p>Add your email settings to the end of the beast/config/environment.rb file.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">email settings</h1>

<p>ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :address =&gt; &ldquo;mail.domain.com&rdquo;,
  :port =&gt; 25,
  :domain =&gt; &ldquo;domain.com&rdquo;,
  :authentication =&gt; :login,
  :user_name =&gt; &ldquo;beast@domain.com&rdquo;,
  :password =&gt; &ldquo;xxxxxxx&rdquo;
}</p>

<p>Initialize Beast</p>

<p>rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=production
mtr add beast $PWD domain.com
mtr start beast
mtr generate_htaccess beast
mtr create_link beast domain.com</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 17, 2007</span>

    <p>Radiohead shocked the music industry, and their fans, by releasing their latest album “In Rainbows” for free. Yes, free as in beer. You pay as much as you think the album is worth.</p>

<p>The Seminal writes:</p>

<p>According to a source close to the band, In Rainbows has sold approximately 1.2 million copies as of October 12th. In comparison, that’s more albums sold in the first week than Radiohead’s last three releases combined. According to an Internet poll of 3,000 people, the average price paid for In Rainbows was $8. If these numbers are accurate, Radiohead has made close to $10 million in one week on this album alone.</p>

<p>This is crazy, but awesome in its own way. Just goes to show how far you can bend without breaking. Visit The Seminal to check the full article out.</p>

        Unicode Django and Textile
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Jul 13, 2007</span>

    <p>Thanks to Django’s great unicode support which merged on July 4 a textile error has emerged. Luckily, there is a remarkably simple fix.</p>

<p>The problem</p>

<p>You used to be able to do this:</p>

<p>textile.textile(self.body)</p>

<p>But that would lead to this error:</p>

<p>&ldquo;ascii&rdquo; codec can&rdquo;t decode byte 0xb4 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)</p>

<p>This happens because textile is trying to map 8-bit ASCII code into HTML numerical entity equivalents, but it is not receiving ASCII.</p>

<p>The Fix</p>

<p>So now you have to do this:</p>

<p>textile.textile(str(self.body))</p>

<p>Honestly, I am not 100% sure why this works but it does. I plan on investigating a little further to find a definite answer but my current guess is that str() gives us the ASCII encoding we need.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 12, 2007</span>

    

<p>Databrowse is a Django application that basically lets you browse your data. You can define which models you want to browse and they are then exposed to Databrowse. Besides being very pretty, Databrowse has come in very handy. And since it is so easy to setup, you can see for yourself in just a few minutes.</p>

<p>Setup</p>

<p>Installing Databrowse is a snap. You could use the documentation, but I want to show you how I did it and save you some time.</p>

<p>First add django.contrib.databrowse to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.</p>

<p>{% highlight python %}</p>

<p>Add ‘django.contrib.databrowse’ to your INSTALLED_APPS</p>

<p>&ldquo;django.contrib.databrowse&rdquo;,
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Now you need to register your models with Databrowse. I did this in my root urls.py, however I plan to try to move the code in to the individual apps once I can figure out how.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Import your model classes in your root urls.py</h1>

<p>from apps.blog.models import Entry</p>

<p>Now we register those models with Databrowse.</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">Register your models with Databrowse</h1>

<h1 id="toc_2">I put this right after my import statements</h1>

<h1 id="toc_3">Entry corresponds with &ldquo;from apps.blog.models import Entry&rdquo;</h1>

<p>databrowse.site.register(Entry)
databrowse.site.register(Project)</p>

<p>Last but not least you need to give your Databrowse app a url.</p>

<h1 id="toc_4">You can give it any name you wish</h1>

<p>(r&rdquo;^databrowse/(.*)&ldquo;, databrowse.site.root),</p>

<p>Now visit your Databrowse url and enjoy looking inside your data.</p>
