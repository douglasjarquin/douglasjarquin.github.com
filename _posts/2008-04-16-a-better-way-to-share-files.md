Aireo is a new web based file management application by the guys of Vure. It has a user friendly Flex based interface that makes handling your files OS like. Data is stored on Amazon S3 in the back end, but Aireo stores aliases of your files in a database. This brilliant implementation allows you to move files between folders, a feature currently unavailable on S3.
