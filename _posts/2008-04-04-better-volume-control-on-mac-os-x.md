The other day I stumbled upon a very useful keyboard shortcut for Mac OS X Leopard. If you hit ‘option’ + ‘shift’ + ‘volume down’ or ‘volume up’ you will get a more sensitive volume control. Four times more sensitive to be exact. This is useful if you have very sensitive speakers that need a smaller adjustment to get to that perfect volume level.

Updates

April 18, 2008: Changed F4 and F5 to Volume Down and Volume Up. Thanks Evgeny.
