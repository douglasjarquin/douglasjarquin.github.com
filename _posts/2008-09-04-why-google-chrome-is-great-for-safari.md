Google Chrome is the new browser on the block, and boy is it getting all the neighborhood girls excited. I am sure you can find some entertaining article about why Google Chrome will rule the world, but I am going to tell you why I like it. Webkit. Yes, Google Chrome uses the exact same rendering engine as Safari which is my browser of choice, mobile Safari, and Android. This means that any site that renders well in Safari will look the same in Google Chrome.

What this also means is that if the adoption of Google Chrome is high enough, which it will be, web designers all over the world can finally give IE the boot. I see the signs already, “This site works fine in Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.” That’s three choices other than IE.
